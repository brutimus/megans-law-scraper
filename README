A web scraper project to pull data from the California Megan's Law
sex offender website at meganslaw.ca.gov.

The scraper utilized the python Scrapy project to search and retrieve
data from the site. Objects are returned to Scrapy's control where
the user can specify the output format.

Currently the scraper runs with one major assumption:

- Only Orange County is scraped

To change this behavior, code will need added/modified.
