A web scraper project to pull data from the California Megan's Law
sex offender website at meganslaw.ca.gov.

This scraper utilizes Selenium in conjunction with Scrapy. Selenium
is required in order to begin the process of working through the
website's JavaScript forms to accept disclaimers, perform searches
and retrieve session data. Once this is setup, Selenium is terminated
and the session data is passed to the native Scrapy spider to perform
the actual data scraping.

Currently the scraper runs with a few assumptions:

- Chrome is used for Selenium
- Only Orange County is scraped

To change these behaviors, code will need added/modified.
